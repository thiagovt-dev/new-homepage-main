# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

For my solution I used css grid styles and javascript. I also used media queries to make the homepage responsive.

Here are some images of the homepage in desktop version
